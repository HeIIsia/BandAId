Bodom_after_midnight = """Bodom After Midnight

(Hang on) got to go
Preview what they oughtta know
Keep your head down and fucking die
(Wake up) rise and shine
Gotta take another pint
Dig heads and watch out for the night
When the sun comes down and the moon comes up in the sky
The battle of the day and the night

(Kill, kill, kill) go fuck another one
Candlelight burns in a wood so high
On a carpet (flying high) take it down to the other side
The way beyond it may lie
When the moon comes up and is rescuing under the night
The reaper is on the other side, let's go

Bodom after midnight
Bodom after midnight yeah"""

Everytime_I_die = """Everytime I Die

The faint blaze of the candle of my life,
slowly dying like a fire in a pouring rain.
No sparks of hope inside,
no shooting stars on my sky.
On broken wings, no flying high...

Another night, another demise,
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice...
I`ll let the wind blow out the light
cause its gets more painful every time I die.

Out of strength to fight.
I cannot take another night.
I cannot take it no more.
Lust of light slips through my fingers
like blood on my arms.
Black candle wax has buried me...

Another night, another demise,
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice...
I`ll let the wind blow out the light
cause its gets more painful every time I die."""

Angels_dont_kill = """Angels Don't Kill

[Spoken (continues from the previous track):]
I want no one to escape.

I hear the footsteps crawling by,
Watching myself slowly die.
Sharp pain is impaling through my heart,
Slowly tearing me apart.

One minute you're an angel fallen from grace,
Next, the fix that I hate.
Pick me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss,
Then rips out my heart to show me how black it is!

No!
You're no good...
It feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'll die alone!

I hear the footsteps walking by,
Watching myself slowly die.
Sharpening pain leading through my heart,
Slowly tearing me apart.

When you appear as an angel
Look at me now, losing my way.
Could you ever kill the pain in my heart
Even though they say angels don't kill?

No!
You're no good...
It feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'm dying alone!

No!
You're no good...
It feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'll die alone!!"""

Come on!

Hey! Don't tell us what you want,
Cause we don't give a fuck about you and your kind.
You! You better take a step back where ever the fuck you came from.
No! You ain't one of us and to be tag along you're too ugly and blunt.
Why?! Is it so hard to get that we don't need you, stupid cunt!

If you don't know how to resent one another,
To gain the new way of power,
It'll get to the point where no one gives a fuck
What you may think of us or what you may not.

Stop! Are you ever gonna stop tryin' to be on the way that we wanna go?
Fuck! It's pissing the fuck out of us when you don't understand the word 'no' !
Now, you're tellin' that you'll win the war that's only battled cause you're
Too dumb to die. That's right! You can take your war and shove it up your ass,
Then close your eyes and say goodbye.

If you don't know how to resent one another,
To gain the new way of power,
It'll get to the point where no one gives a fuck
What you may think of us or what you may not.

We're hate crew, we stand and we won't fall...
We're all for none and none for all.
Fuck you! We'll fight 'til the last hit
And we sure as hell ain't taking no shit!"""

Woah yeow

They try kicking and screaming as loud
Contation break us apart
Will not control us they won't hold you down
I'm sorry, that's my knife in you!
Another day of falling down your way
Pushing and screaming cause
They thought it might be right

Hey

Take my hand and fly
Will you ever be that tall
Don't you be afraid
We're not gonna fall

Did you think
I'd let you mix it up
Give me a reason bitch
You're gonna fuck it up

Hey

Take my hand and fly
Will you ever be that tall
Don't you be afraid
We're not gonna fall

Hey

Do you believe in what we've got
Try it, take your one shot
We stand once and for all
We're not gonna fall

[Solo]

Well you thought you had the authority
To slay and kill the minority
Together we stand tall
Not gonna crash, not gonna fall

Did you think I'd let you mix it up
Give me a reason bitch
I'm gonna fuck you up
It's real, into the charge

At the end we're standing up"""
